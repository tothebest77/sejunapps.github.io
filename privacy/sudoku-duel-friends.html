  <h1>Sudoku Duel Friends Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies to the mobile application <strong>&quot;Sudoku Duel Friends&quot;</strong>

  </p>

  <p>
    The app does not directly request users to manually enter personal information such as name, address,
    or phone number. However, the app uses third-party services (e.g., Firebase and AdMob) that may
    automatically collect certain information for functionality, analytics, stability, and advertising.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <li>Operate and improve app stability and performance (e.g., crash analysis)</li>
    <li>Analyze usage trends to improve user experience</li>
    <li>Display ads and measure ad performance</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell users’ personal information. Data may be shared with third-party service providers
    (such as Google) solely for providing the services described above.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Data collected by third-party services is retained according to the policies and settings of those services.
    The Developer does not control the retention period of data stored and processed by those providers.

    take appropriate action.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect information processed by the app and third-party services.
    However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your Choices</h2>
  <p>
    You can stop all data collection by uninstalling the app. You may also reset your device advertising ID
    through your device settings (availability depends on your device/OS).
